    <div class="post-content">
      <p>On August 6th, 1945, the world’s first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, and on August 9th, the second one followed. On September 2nd, 1945, Japan surrendered, and World War II stopped. World War II was a human slaughter where almost all the countries were participating, using all their resources, and the boundaries between military and civilians were very blurred at that time. These two atomic bombs led to the surrender of Japan, marking the end of World War II.</p>

<p>The USA celebrated their victory against Japan. The war between them started when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, US, on December 7th, 1941. Peace was being restored in the world again, but this peace came with a greater price. The scenes at Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing sites were horrible. Such powerful weapons were used for the first time on any human civilization. The effects of the destruction were not only visible at that time but also passed through future generations. These were weapons of mass destruction, weapons of the destruction of life.</p>

<p>To paint the story of the destruction and to warn the world of its horrors, the survivors of those attacks came together to tell their stories. They gathered 11 years after the incident, after silently suffering unimaginable pain, and formed an organization named Nihon Hidankyo.</p>

</div>
<p>Nihon Hidankyo is an organization that represents the survivors (known as hibakusha) of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This organization’s appeal is that the world, or humanity, must never again conflict or suffer as they have, and atomic forces, which have the potential to be used for mass destruction, should only be used to bring happiness or serve humankind. And they say, “This is the only desire we hold as long as we live.”</p>

<p>Through the work of the organization, through surveys and the stories of the survivors, they showed that the bomb did not only lead to immediate deaths, but people were also dying even after the attack. On August 6th in Hiroshima and August 9th in Nagasaki in 1945, 2,797 people were killed. The hardships did not stop for the people who survived these bombs. They started dying one after another, and approximately 90% (around 210,000) were dead by 1965, labeled as “later deaths.” The destruction was so severe that people had to flee their houses in fire and try to escape. Even the deaths at that time could not be called the deaths of human beings. As they say, it “was beyond imagination.”</p>

<p>The picture was not really bright for those who survived. There are hundreds and hundreds of witness stories depicting the horrific visuals that they saw around them. The suffering they endured to survive, the people they left behind, the people who died by drowning themselves just to rid themselves of the burning sensation they experienced due to radiation exposure. In one of the surveys, they showed that the survivors (hibakusha) suffered discrimination even in their own country. They faced difficulties in getting jobs, and people refused to marry them, fearing they had been exposed to radiation, which could pass on diseases to the next generation. Many of them shared that they lived under constant anxiety.</p>

<p>We humans do a lot of things to remain in power, to create stories, to build narratives, just for the need to rule the world. After these atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and after Japan surrendered, US forces strictly prohibited people from speaking about the after-effects of the bombing and the damage they had caused, including the miserable deaths of more than two lakh people. The Japanese government itself renounced its right to claim damages from the US in the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty. Hibakusha have suffered from negligence by the government, social discrimination, and disadvantages in society.</p>

<p>Nihon Hidankyo is the organization of hibakusha people. Together with victims of nuclear testing, they appeal to the world for a nuclear-free world. Through their persistent efforts and the stories they bring through documentation and analysis, they present the horrors humanity can face if another such weapon of mass destruction is used. They continue sharing their stories with the world, warning of what can go wrong, where we need to pay attention, and how, if neglected, it can lead to the mass destruction of life itself. They ask for an end to atomic or nuclear power in war, nuclear testing, and funding for such research unless it is used to bring happiness or serve humanity.</p>
