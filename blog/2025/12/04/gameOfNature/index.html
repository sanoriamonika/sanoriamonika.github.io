      <!-- Problem solving: Game of nature  -->
<h3 id="short-summary">Short Summary:</h3>

<p>We enter life knowing nothing, yet we slowly discover hidden patterns that govern survival—hunger, danger, desire, and belonging. By watching others, we realize these patterns shape belief systems, choices, and the entire cycle of life. From ancient cells forming alliances to modern societies sharing knowledge, survival has always scaled through collaboration. And now, with AI merging collective intelligence, we may be entering the next level of this “game.” The question is: how much of it do we truly understand?</p>

<h3 id="the-game-we-enter-without-knowing">The Game We Enter Without Knowing</h3>

<p>What do we know about this world? Nothing. I was somehow a child, then mysteriously my body changed, and things around me continuously changed. It seems to happen linearly, and this effect is called <em>time</em>. I consume things around me that my body craves. There are some people who brought me here, and other beings who helped me adjust to this world. I see that some of those people look very different, their skin becomes loose, they walk differently, and slowly they cannot fulfill the needs of their body. Eventually their body stops functioning altogether. After that, there is no movement or any function that existed before.</p>

<p>Everything has a pattern. Some people develop saggy skin, a bent walking posture, and eventually stop all activities; at that point, their bodies are either burned or buried. Another pattern: someone is born, reaches childhood, adulthood, middle age, old age, and then dies. Have I seen one person go through all stages fully? No. But because I have seen different people at different points, I can extrapolate that this is the cycle.</p>

<p>We see that our bodies force us to eat. Everyone cries or becomes restless if not fed. We eat plants, animals, and fruits to curb hunger. After eating, we become calmer and able to behave normally. When there is hunger, humans or animals are ruled by that feeling more than any other sense.
Sexual desire is similar. When the desire arises, it takes over behavior, and people behave differently. Once that need is fulfilled, the mind becomes free to think more clearly. Similarly, when danger is present, the feeling of protecting ourselves dominates everything. Until danger passes, the system does not function calmly. These seem to be priorities.
A difficult question is: if hunger, danger, and sexual desire arise together, which one would a human satisfy first?</p>

<p>Where we live, we have seen behaviors around us, and naturally we feel more comfortable satisfying these needs in a particular order. Maybe because, from patterns, we assume that if many people act in a certain way, it is probably the best way to survive. There is comfort in patterns.
<strong>Our beliefs are formed through patterns.</strong> What is a belief system?
Something that has not harmed us yet and seemed useful becomes accepted as right. There is safety in repeating patterns. When someone else’s patterns have worked reliably for many years, we are inclined to follow them.
We saw that needs were fulfilled for those who studied and worked; we wanted to do the same because it increased the chances of our safety and the safety of those trying to ensure our survival.
So, survival became another subtle game behind hunger, sex, and danger.</p>

<p>We play this game from subtle needs to strong needs by learning patterns through observing others. Better pattern recognition improves survival. Every understanding feels solid until new information arrives and gives more clarity.
It is like in a video game. A player suddenly finds themselves in a world; the aim becomes survival. Out of an entire population, maybe half decide to survive and half do not. We only observe the half that survive, so we assume survival is the main purpose. The question becomes: how long will it take for the player to figure out the rules of the game?
I, like others, have been thrown into this game, and without knowing it, I play it by looking at patterns others follow. Better pattern recognition, better survival.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-have-i-understood-about-the-game-collective-existence-improves-survival">So what have I understood about the game? Collective Existence Improves Survival</h2>

<p>Collectiveness has consistently helped survival and helped develop better pattern recognition. This is true across scales from cells, to animals, to humans.
Whoever found the next cue survived. Whoever adapted to new environments survived.
There were no fixed rules; the method did not matter.
A factual example:
Cells and mitochondria originally existed as separate organisms. Over time, through mutually beneficial interactions, mitochondria were absorbed into larger host cells and began living symbiotically. Today, every human cell contains mitochondria, and mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively from the mother. To overcome increasing survival challenges, individual cells eventually formed multicellular communities, which then gave rise to tissues, organs, and coordinated systems. This evolutionary pathway ultimately led to the complex multicellular organisms we see today, including humans.</p>

<p>Humans learned individually (e.g., hunting alone), then collectively (farming), which increased stability and safety. With scale, villages emerged, then cities. Religion united thousands under shared beliefs which is another scaling mechanism.
A major milestone was the idea of codifying and publishing knowledge, allowing future generations and even different countries to work on the same problems.
This dramatically increased the <em>scale of problem-solving</em>.
Now countries work simultaneously on the same ideas, trying not to fall behind.</p>

<p>Has this reduced problems?
No, we now have more problems and more solutions, but in focused directions—directions that survived curiosity, necessity, or the test of time.
Now AI collects past knowledge and accelerates idea development. This feels like another scaling layer.
Sometimes I wonder: is this scaling following a power-law pattern?</p>

<!-- What do we know about this world? nothing. I was somehow very child like mystriously my body changed things around me is continously changes and it seems to be linear and this effect is called time. I consume things from around which my body ffels craving for there are some people who brought me here and some other being who wants to help me get adjusted in this world. I see some of them looks very different (their skin is legiging, they walk different from other and have one of other things which make them unable to fulfil the needs of the body. Then day stop function at all. After that time there is no movement or any sort of functing it was doing before. Everything has pattern … some people have saggy skin, bend walkin g and eventually stop all activities and they are either burnt ot dafan. another pattern just born reseaches adult age, adult reaches mid life and mid life goes to old age and old age people die with few dies  earluy. (have i seen one person going through all the stages? no.. but because i have seen one changes in another so i can extrapolate that this is the entire cycle in front of us. 

We saw our bodies forces us to eat. Everyone cry or get crazy if not fed. We eat plants, animals, fruits to curve our hunger. after eating we become normal and able to behave relaxed. If there is hunger human/speciour are rules by that feelingnot any other sense. Similar sex is another. If there is desire of mating one feeling taken over by that desire and human behave very different;y. Once that need is fulfilled then if mind is relaxed to think. Similarly, if ther is danger is there feeling of saving/protecting ourself stays on us. Untill that goes aways we dont function relaxed that seems very periority to is. We have seen these pattern. 
A though question is hunger, danger and need of mating arise tohether wha will one choose to satisfy first?

Where we live we saw sopme thing happening in some way we naturally felt comfortabel in satisfing these things in that order. May be because somewhere again from patterns we know that if a thing is done in this way by so many people that is efectively/probably the best thing to do. Just the cumfort of the patterns. 

Patterns and decoding from this made our all beliefs. What is belif system .. thisngs that wont kill us are good for us in one way or another way. THere is safty in the repeating patterns. More safe you are in tha paterns of someone if you see someone whose pattern has been right for most of your life if given a choice. 

We saw needs were fullfilled of someone who studied and did things which was part of job, we wanted to do that because there was more safety of saving oneself and of the ones which are trying to save us (another way of saving self). Trying to save selve (in the unknown game of the world) is another game(patterns) that is more subtle behind al these games of hunger, sex, and survivial form danger. 

So we play this game from suble to strong needs. But how? how do we find and undersnad the rules and use it? from pattern recognision from interpolation and exterapolation of ideas. So patterns recognision is something which we need to understand the game better. Every understandign is solid until some new clue comes up and give us more clarity of the things. 
It is like in video game countra is being played by characters and a character is through wich now notheing and iot has to survive it he/she choses to(probablistic half will decide to survuve and half will not and we will see the game of the only half who decide to survive which amde us thing as if survival is the only game being played). Now whow the player will sruvive while figuring the rules of the game or in how many life time player will be abnle to figure out the game?

I, Moun, just like athers has been through into this game and without knowing it I am playing this games by looking at the patters others. Game of trying to servive by finding the patterns. Bettor pattern recognisation better my survival. 

##### So what I have figured it out about the game? **Pattern1:Game1**

Collectiness has made life to function better at survival and at bettor pattern recognision. And it did figured out it in this game and chosses to function that way. And that lead to the diversity we see all around us. 
who ever(cells, animal to human.. ) was  able to find the next cue survived.. was able to adapt in the new enviromrnt survived,, 
no rules: irrispective how you do it.. (cell and mitocondiria)
For example in case of cells and mitocondria realized that they are better togetor for each other (happened with collaboration that benefit both goes long way ) and hence they lived together after that each of our cells are like this and mitocondrias are passed by mother (assuming current sicece knoeledge). To further solve probelm multicellularity comes in existence. To solve hte survival from the envirnmet conditions and events that happended we are a form which was best to survive. We learn individually alongwith other specious how to find food, mate and stay safe. 
 We as human able to  solve idea on the idividual level(alone hunting) by chance lead to better survival safety. it became the persistent desire and few people together start solving the problem (farming) . The scale incresed with increse in people village were able to find and solve bigger mistories and bending nature with them. Then cities brought more. religion was able to bring thousdand of people together in an idea so ,,, propered inthe game of life 
Another breakthgough of scale came with the idea of "publish idea" and a lot more people were working on an idea in future and worldwide across nation together in one direction. This increased the scale of probelm finding and solving. See almost all nations working on few ideas trying to catch up with other in the directions of the ideas which became very popular. Have it made system with less problem. No we have more probelms and more solutions but in one direction, in the direction of the idea which survived the test of time or human curiosity and our want ot survive.
and now AI able to bring past and power all ideas together it is like another scaling. Just wandering is it a power law like scaling :D -->
