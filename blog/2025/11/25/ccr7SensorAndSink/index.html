<p>CCR7 is a chemokine receptor expressed on several types of white blood cells (leukocytes), especially T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells. It plays a key role in guiding these immune cells to lymph nodes, where immune responses are organized and activated.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows how immune cells develop from hematopoietic stem cells. Immune cells include all the cells that defend the body against infections, viruses, and abnormal or damaged cells. They include all white blood cells (leukocytes) as well as several tissue-resident immune cells that do not circulate in the blood. These immune cells exist in different proportions in the body, as illustrated in Figure 3. Leukocytes themselves are classified into granular and non-granular (agranular) types, as shown in Figure 4.</p>

<p>Dendritic cells (DCs, Figure 1) are present throughout the body and act as the immune system’s sentinels. When they circulate in the blood, they are considered leukocytes, but once they mature and reside in tissues, they are classified as tissue-resident immune cells. Their role is to constantly survey the environment and ensure that everything is normal. When dendritic cells detect a pathogen, antigen, or abnormal cell, they capture and process that information and signal to T cells and B cells that an immune response is needed. In this way, dendritic cells function like messengers or scouts that alert and activate the rest of the immune system when danger is present.</p>

<p>There is still much we do not understand about dendritic cells and the roles of their receptors. A deeper understanding of how they function could greatly improve our ability to strengthen and regulate the body’s defense system.</p>

<h4 id="central-question-and-main-findings">Central Question and Main Findings</h4>
<!-- [old blog](/blog/2025/10/01/EndocytosisCollectiveCellProperties/), -->
<p>In the previous two blogs(<a href="/blog/2025/11/23/ReceptorFate/">a</a>,<a href="/blog/2025/11/24/Chemorepulsion/">b</a>), we saw that the receptor CCR7 interacts with the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, and depending on the concentration, CCR7 undergoes endocytosis. During this process, CCL19 is degraded in the lysosome while CCR7 is recycled back to the cell surface.</p>

<p>In this work, the authors ask a straightforward question: since each cell not only senses chemokines but also degrades them through CCR7-mediated endocytosis, does this local consumption create a chemokine deficiency that can reshape the chemical landscape? And if so, is this self-generated gradient strong enough to influence the migration of other cells?</p>

<p>To investigate this, they combine biological experiments with computational modeling. Where they find as Dendritic cells expressing CCR7 bind CCL19, internalize it, and degrade it inside lysosomes. This creates a local depletion of chemokine, effectively forming a gradient even when no external gradient exists. The authors show that this self-generated gradient is sufficient to guide other cells, such as T cells, allowing them to migrate with higher persistence even in an environment that originally had a uniform chemokine distribution.</p>

<h4 id="techniques-assays-and-analysis-pipeline">Techniques, Assays, and Analysis Pipeline</h4>

<p>In this study, the authors investigate in-vitro migration of mouse dendritic cells (DCs) and use mouse T cells along with two modified DC types, CCR7-KO and Lfc-KO, to test whether DCs can generate their own chemokine gradients. Their central idea is that DCs not only sense the chemokine CCL19 but also degrade it through CCR7-mediated endocytosis, potentially creating small chemokine-depleted regions around themselves. To test this idea, they designed a series of migration assays using the under-agarose setup, which allows precise observation of directional movement. First, they compared normal DCs with CCR7-KO DCs to confirm that CCR7 is required for directional migration. Next, they created an asymmetric under-agarose setup where the chemokine field was uniform but DCs were placed only on one side. Even without an external gradient, the presence of WT DCs on one side caused local chemokine depletion, producing a self-generated gradient that other cells could follow. They then tested Lfc-KO DCs, which can sense chemokine but cannot internalize it. As expected, Lfc-KO DCs did not create gradients because they were unable to endocytose CCL19, showing that chemokine uptake is essential for self-generated gradient formation. Finally, they mixed WT DCs with T cells and found that T cells migrated with greater persistence when DCs were present, even in a uniform chemokine field, suggesting that T cells can use DC-generated gradients as guidance cues. Their results also indicate that higher DC density strengthens this effect because more cells collectively consume chemokine and create a sharper local gradient.</p>

<p>To carry out these experiments, the authors used collagen migration assays, under-agarose assays, and DC–T cell co-migration experiments, all recorded with wide-field time-lapse microscopy. They analyzed trajectories using TrackMate in Fiji, measured CCR7 surface levels with flow cytometry, and imaged CCR7 internalization and CCL19 uptake using point-scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 880). DC and T cell co-migration was recorded using standard fluorescence microscopy. One of the clearest demonstrations was the asymmetric under-agarose experiment, which showed that DCs can create and maintain a directional cue even in a completely uniform chemokine environment. Overall, the study emphasizes that immune cells are not passive responders to external gradients but can actively shape their own chemical environment. This highlights the importance of collective behavior, cell density, and microenvironmental context in guiding immune cell migration.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="reflections">Reflections</h4>
<p>Fig. 6(a) shows that even in the absence of an imposed gradient, meaning in uniform CCL19, T cells still migrate with a measurable persistence of about 0.5. This persistence is lower than what they show when following WT DCs, but it is clearly not random motion. If we extend this idea to the cells used in our own system, it raises an interesting possibility: even when no external gradient is present, there may still be subtle self-generated gradients influencing the direction of migration. This makes me wonder about the potential role and strength of self-generated gradients in our system, especially in situations where the environment appears uniform but the cells themselves could be reshaping it.</p>
