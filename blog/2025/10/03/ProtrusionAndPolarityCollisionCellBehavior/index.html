<p>Such interesting problems to think about — every layer brings new complexity.</p>

<p>Now imagine <strong>two cells colliding</strong> with each other — this is another level of a ball game. They are <em>adaptive materials</em>, ever-evolving. There are hundreds of thousands of processes happening inside a cell at any given time. It is converting ATP to ADP, allowing ions to diffuse, performing endocytosis to engulf larger particles, and exocytosis to release waste materials. There is continuous transport of cargo between the cell interior and its surface for these processes. Meanwhile, RNA is synthesizing new proteins from DNA through transcription and translation, and the Golgi apparatus is sending them to where they are needed. Chromosomes may even be aligning into their characteristic shape just before cell division.</p>

<p>Now imagine — the cell sees another cell approaching, about to collide. What will it do? How will it behave? What will its trajectory look like, and how will its surface fluctuate?</p>

<h3 id="the-cellular-architecture"><strong>The Cellular Architecture</strong></h3>

<p>A cell is far more intricate than a “hard core and soft shell.” It has <em>building blocks</em>. Its outer layer — the <strong>cytoplasm</strong> — is highly elastic. It can deform from a 3D shape to a 2D-like shape, almost like a “super material,” with the constraint that its volume remains constant at all times. The cytoplasm is filled with <strong>actomyosin networks, microtubules, and organelles</strong>. Actin and myosin form a dynamic, contractile network near the cell membrane — a <strong>lipid bilayer</strong> embedded with various proteins. These proteins mediate interactions with the environment and act as <strong>ion channels</strong>. The actomyosin cortex forms parallel and cross-linked structures that continuously reorganize — polymerizing and depolymerizing — as the cell forms protrusions to explore new regions. These protrusions extend the network in particular directions, allowing the cell to explore and sense its environment for potential connections.</p>

<h3 id="the-cell-surface-and-adhesion-machinery"><strong>The Cell Surface and Adhesion Machinery</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to these internal actomyosin structures, the <strong>cell membrane</strong> has functional proteins (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein">cell surface proteins</a>) that include <em>signaling proteins</em>, <em>transport proteins</em>, and <em>adhesion molecules</em>.</p>

<p>These <strong>cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)</strong> mediate binding to either the <strong>extracellular matrix (ECM)</strong> or other cells (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_junction#:~:text=The%20molecules%20responsible%20for%20creating,integrins%2C%20and%20the%20immunoglobulin%20superfamily.">cell junctions</a>).</p>

<p>CAMs are mainly divided into four categories depending on the type of interaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Immunoglobulin Superfamily (IgSF CAMs)</strong> — cell–cell and cell–ECM binding (calcium-independent)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cadherins</strong> — cell–cell binding, especially in epithelial tissues (calcium-dependent)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Selectins</strong> — cell–cell binding in immune cells (calcium-dependent)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Integrins</strong> — cell–ECM binding (calcium-dependent)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>How these molecules form bonds and how long they remain connected is still an active area of research.</p>

<h3 id="polarity-and-complexity"><strong>Polarity and Complexity</strong></h3>
<p>Cells also exhibit <strong>polarity</strong> — they are not circularly symmetric. One side acts as the front, the opposite as the back, and the adhesion and surface dynamics differ drastically between the two ends. This adds yet another layer of complexity to cell–cell interactions.</p>

<p>Recent work aims to understand what happens when cells interact with each other (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/">PNAS, 2021</a>) and which types of interactions dominate such encounters (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prxlife/">PRX Life, 2025</a>).</p>

<!-- - Two hard bolls collide.. what happens?
- What happens if two soft boll collide? how does its shape changes? how does its surface fluctuate?
- Now what if there is a hard boll inside soft boll and these two bolls collide with each other..how does trajectories change now? how does surface fluctuate now?
- What if hard boll is not hard, but it has some elasticity, but it is lesser than the elasticity of the soft boll… then what happens?
- Now what if these piezoelectricity like properties and the show somw kind of attractive and repulsive forces between each other.
  
Such interesting problems to think about.. every layer brings new complexity.. Now imagine two cells colliding with each other this is another level of ball game. They are adaptable materials, ever evolving. There are hundred thousand things going on with cell at each time.. it is converting ATP to ADP, letting ions diffuse, doing endocytosis to each bigger particles, exocytosis to release waste materials, transport of these contents from different parts of the cell to the surface for exocytosis and endocytosis like processes, RNA creating new material from DNA through RNA transcriptions, Golgi apparatus sending it where it needs to be used… may be chromosomes and aligning into their famous shape just before the  division of the cell and many others. Just imagine now it sees another cell coming toward it with which is going to collide, what will it do? How is it going to behave? How its trajectories are going to look like and how its surface is going to fluctuate? 

In addition, a cell is not simple as elastic nucleus and soft ball covering it. It has its building blocks. It has very elastic outer layer which is called cytoplasm it can deform from 3d like shape to 2d like shape it is like supper material, with the condition its volume remain constant at any point. Cytoplasm is filled with acto-myosin microtubules and oraganals. Actin and myosin create rigid structure around cells membrane which is bilayer lipid membrane. This membrane has protein embedded in it which leads varies interaction with the surrounding and also acts as ion channels for some of the ions. This actomyosins forms parallel and cross-linked structure which is continuously changing as this structure keep on depolymerizing (breaking) and polymerizing (making) as these cells form protrusions and to explore the new regions. These protrusions which are made by extending this network in any direction are used to explore new areas as well as sense the environments for new connections.

In addition to these niternal actomyosin strucutre close to the cell membrane have functional proteins ([Cell surface proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein)). which are mainly categorized into *singnalling proteins*, *transport proteins*, *adhesion molecules* etc. These cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) have function of binding with either extracellular matrix (ECM) or other cells (see <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_junction#:~:text=The%20molecules%20responsible%20for%20creating,integrins%2C%20and%20the%20immunoglobulin%20superfamily.">Cell Junctions</a>). These CAMs are mainly divided into four categories depending on interaction with other cells or ECM (ImmunoGlobin SUperFamily(IgSF CAM), integrins, cadherins, Selectins), these categories are further divided into two categories of calcium independent (IgSF CAM) or calcium dependent (integrins, cadherins, Selectins). IgSF CAM is super family is involved in cell-cell as well cell-ECM binding, cadhrins are involved in cell-cell binding specially in epithelial, selectins in cell-cell binding in immune cells, integrins in cell-ECM. 
How they form bonds for how long they stay connected, I don't know. 

In addition, they have cell polarity as well, i.e cell will not be circularly symmetric. One part of the cell will act as front and opposite as back and surface and adhesion dynamics will be very different on the both ends. This added another complexity in the cell interactions. 

Authors are trying to understand what is going on when cell interacts with each other (PNAS 2021) and second which type of interactions dominates the cell-cell interactions (PRX LIFE 2025). -->
