      <h4 id="quick-summary-of-the-paper">Quick summary of the paper</h4>
<p><em>Dictyostelium discoideum</em> (a cellular slime mold) shows chemorepulsion. It was known that cell secreate a protein(AprA) of approximately 60 kDa (<strong>kDa</strong> = kilodalton, a unit of molecular mass) is responsible for this effect, but there were suggestions that a smaller molecule (around &lt;10 kDa) also participates in chemorepulsion. The authors of this work identified that smaller molecule (PolyP) and, in addition, investigated the mechanisms of chemorepulsion. They found that the two chemorepellent signals use different mechanisms and signaling pathways, but both involve Ras activity. In one pathway, Ras activity is <em>suppressed</em> on the contact side, whereas in the smaller-molecule pathway, Ras activity is <em>redirected</em> while the overall Ras activity remains unchanged.</p>

<h4 id="introduction-to-the-system">Introduction to the system</h4>
<p>Growing up I was always confused between slime molds and fungi (mushrooms). They look alike, similar in appearance and only differing in size. When you press a mushroom, it feels solid with a stem, but when you touch a slime mold, a thick liquid oozes out.<br />
As a child, I wondered if slime molds could be cooked and eaten like mushrooms. Maybe they did harden when cooked — or perhaps they were just “young mushrooms.”</p>

<p>Let me show you some pictures:</p>

The images that we are looking at are called <strong>fruiting body</strong>,  is the <strong>reproductive structure</strong> produced by certain organisms to <strong>make and release spores</strong>. Think of it like the “flower” of these organisms and it’s not the whole organism, but the part that appears when it’s ready to reproduce.</p>

<h4 id="life-cycle">Life cycle</h4>

<p>It become difficult to ditinguish them but just looking at the Images of fruiting body only. TO understand lets lok at their life cycle process. I am showing three type of life cycle</p>

<p><strong>Dictyostelium discoideum</strong>, commonly known as a slime mold, is a fascinating organism.<br />
Here’s how it differs from fungi (mushrooms):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Slime molds</strong> move (~1–2 cm/hr), while fungi do not.</li>
  <li><strong>Slime mold fruiting bodies</strong> are millimeters in size, while mushrooms are centimeters.</li>
  <li><strong>Slime molds</strong> are microorganisms that exist as single cells and as multicellular forms during their life cycle, usually in damp environments.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Life cycle of a plasmodial slime mold (myxomycete):</strong><br />
The fruiting bodies emerge from a diploid plasmodium and release haploid spores (8–10 µm in diameter) that spread by wind. Spores germinate into two types of gametes (+ and −), which feed on bacteria and eventually fuse to form a diploid zygote. This zygote develops into a plasmodium that later produces new fruiting bodies, continuing the cycle. These plasmodia often carry specific bacteria to new habitats, helping establish new colonies — a kind of “microbial farming.”</p>

<!-- They used _spot assay_ and _Insall chamber_ experimental setup. In *spot assay* At the centre of the agar disc they create a well/hole and used it to fill with the substance they want to study its effect on the cell which are placed in relatively smaller circle at a small distance away from this big well. Over the time this chemical diffuses and one tracks the response of the cell in response to that to study the effect on the cell whether it is chemorepulsive or not. Whereas in *Insall Chamber*  is used to create a chemical gradient and to study the farward migration, velocity, peristance more precise masuremnt os the cell particles. 

They used their guess that the other molecule that leading to chemorepulsion is smaller that 10 kDa, so using a *10kDa spin filter* they extracted the all the molecule that has size <10kDa. Then they studied the cell migration under their presence (Flow through (FT) in Figure 1) and they found cell showing chemorepuslion. Now they step by step process of breaking each molecule in <10kDa using counter molecule and studied the migration of the cell (See Figure1) here PB indicates phosphate buffer. Samples were then assayed for chemorepulsion using spot assays.  Then they added DNAse (break the DNA), Proteinase (breaks the protein), Expopolyphospatase (PPX) and stuidend the migration of the cells. They found that cells showd chemorepuslion even when DNA and protein were broken but when polyphosphaste were broken chemorepusion disappered, varifing that polyposphaste is that molecule that leads to the chemorepulsion.

To variefy this they studied cell migration by adding a modied chanin of hte polyphasphate. Naturally accuing polyphaspjate for this system is 46-monomer polysphsphate and they studied it in 13-monomer polypoasphate and they found still the presence of chemorepulsion and showing that it is th monomer that matters. By looking at the Ras activity in th epresence of polyP molecule they found that it does not change the overall Ras acitivity it redirect is toward the farthest end, whereas in the ArA proeting it superesses the Ras activity. THey also lookked at the signalling pathways by cretaig a library of cells mofieing the genes to stuuded the eggect of differnet sinalling molecule and figure out the pathways. They founs that altough there is similar numebr of molecule invloved in both the chemorepulsion process, there are some differnet comelcule involved in the signaling pathways. -->
<p>They used spot assays and an Insall chamber experimental setup. In a spot assay, a small well is created at the center of an agar disc and filled with the substance being tested. Cells are placed in a smaller circle some distance away from this central well. Over time, the chemical diffuses through the agar, and the movement of the cells is tracked to determine whether the substance is chemorepulsive or not.
The Insall chamber, on the other hand, is used to create a controlled chemical gradient to measure forward migration, velocity, and persistence, allowing more precise quantification of cell movement.</p>

<p>Based on their hypothesis that the other molecule responsible for chemorepulsion is smaller than 10 kDa, they used a 10 kDa spin filter to collect all molecules smaller than 10 kDa. They then studied cell migration in the presence of this fraction (the flow-through, FT, in Figure 1) and found that the cells still showed chemorepulsion.
Next, they systematically broke down the molecules smaller than 10 kDa using specific enzymes and tested cell migration again (see Figure 1). Here, PB indicates phosphate buffer. Samples were assayed for chemorepulsion using spot assays. The researchers added DNase (to degrade DNA), proteinase (to degrade proteins), and exopolyphosphatase (PPX) (to degrade polyphosphate), and then examined cell migration. They found that cells still showed chemorepulsion when DNA and proteins were degraded, but when polyphosphate was broken down, chemorepulsion disappeared, confirming that polyphosphate is the molecule responsible for the repulsion effect.</p>

<p>To further verify this, they studied cell migration after adding modified polyphosphate chains. The naturally occurring polyphosphate in this system is a 46-mer, and they also tested a shorter 13-mer polyphosphate. They found that chemorepulsion still occurred, showing that the monomer length does not significantly alter the effect.
By examining Ras activity in the presence of polyP, they found that it does not change overall Ras activity but instead redirects it toward the farthest side, whereas AprA protein suppresses Ras activity. They also investigated the signaling pathways by creating a library of genetically modified cells to study the effects of different signaling molecules. They found that although a similar number of molecules are involved in both chemorepulsion pathways, some components differ between the two mechanisms.</p>

<p>How do these results make sense?</p>

  <p>Example: The protein suppresses Ras on the contact side; the small molecule redirects Ras activity.</p>
