<p><em>Dictyostelium discoideum</em> (a cellular slime mold) shows chemorepulsion. It was known that cell secreate a protein(AprA) of approximately 60 kDa (<strong>kDa</strong> = kilodalton, a unit of molecular mass) is responsible for this effect, but there were suggestions that a smaller molecule (around &lt;10 kDa) also participates in chemorepulsion. The authors of this work identified that smaller molecule (PolyP) and, in addition, investigated the mechanisms of chemorepulsion. They found that the two chemorepellent signals use different mechanisms and signaling pathways, but both involve Ras activity. In one pathway, Ras activity is <em>suppressed</em> on the contact side, whereas in the smaller-molecule pathway, Ras activity is <em>redirected</em> while the overall Ras activity remains unchanged.</p>

      <em class="figcaption">The small (&lt;10 kDa) chemorepellent is broken down when treated with polyphosphatase, showing it’s a type of polyphosphate. Researchers collected fluid from growing _Dictyostelium_ cells, filtered it, and tested how enzyme treatments affected cell movement. Each point shows an independent experiment (at least 20 cells per test, n = 3). Error bars show variation between experiments; **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001, ns = not significant.

<p>They used spot assays and an Insall chamber experimental setup. In a spot assay, a small well is created at the center of an agar disc and filled with the substance being tested. Cells are placed in a smaller circle some distance away from this central well. Over time, the chemical diffuses through the agar, and the movement of the cells is tracked to determine whether the substance is chemorepulsive or not.
The Insall chamber, on the other hand, is used to create a controlled chemical gradient to measure forward migration, velocity, and persistence, allowing more precise quantification of cell movement.</p>

<p>Based on their hypothesis that the other molecule responsible for chemorepulsion is smaller than 10 kDa, they used a 10 kDa spin filter to collect all molecules smaller than 10 kDa. They then studied cell migration in the presence of this fraction (the flow-through, FT, in Figure 1) and found that the cells still showed chemorepulsion.
Next, they systematically broke down the molecules smaller than 10 kDa using specific enzymes and tested cell migration again (see Figure 1). Here, PB indicates phosphate buffer. Samples were assayed for chemorepulsion using spot assays. The researchers added DNase (to degrade DNA), proteinase (to degrade proteins), and exopolyphosphatase (PPX) (to degrade polyphosphate), and then examined cell migration. They found that cells still showed chemorepulsion when DNA and proteins were degraded, but when polyphosphate was broken down, chemorepulsion disappeared, confirming that polyphosphate is the molecule responsible for the repulsion effect.</p>

<p>To further verify this, they studied cell migration after adding modified polyphosphate chains. The naturally occurring polyphosphate in this system is a 46-mer, and they also tested a shorter 13-mer polyphosphate. They found that chemorepulsion still occurred, showing that the monomer length does not significantly alter the effect.
By examining Ras activity in the presence of polyP, they found that it does not change overall Ras activity but instead redirects it toward the farthest side, whereas AprA protein suppresses Ras activity. They also investigated the signaling pathways by creating a library of genetically modified cells to study the effects of different signaling molecules. They found that although a similar number of molecules are involved in both chemorepulsion pathways, some components differ between the two mechanisms.</p>

  <li>Slime molds blur the line between single-cell and multicellular life. They show cooperation and intelligence without a brain.</li>
  <li>Slime mold cells use two distinct chemorepulsion strategies:
    <ul>
      <li>AprA: inhibits Ras → blocks pseudopods near the source (passive avoidance).</li>
      <li>PolyP: activates Ras → stimulates pseudopods away from the source (active escape).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
