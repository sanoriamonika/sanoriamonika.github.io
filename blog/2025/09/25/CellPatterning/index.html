      <p>This paper had multiple layers that I needed to understand. At first, I was drawn in by the theme of collective migration, but as I read further, many more layers unfolded. What are mesenchymal cells? How do they contribute to morphogenesis? What is their role in development? I remembered something about EMT (epithelial–mesenchymal transition), but not in detail. So, this article took me on a journey of digging into the literature.</p>

<p>To answer these questions, let’s start from ourselves. Humans have always been curious about how we develop from a small embryo into a complex being. How do our bones grow, our tissues form, and our abilities emerge? Since studying this directly in humans is difficult—we are highly evolved and complex—researchers often use simpler model organisms. Popular examples include <em>Drosophila</em> (fruit fly), zebrafish, frogs, and <em>Platynereis</em>. These species are relatively easy to maintain in the lab, their embryos are transparent, and their populations can be observed in real time, making them ideal for studying development.</p>

<p>An embryo is the early developmental stage of an organism. In humans, this refers to the period roughly 2–6 weeks after fertilization. During these stages, the fertilized egg undergoes gastrulation, forming three layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>ectoderm</strong> is the outer layer, giving rise to the skin and nervous system.</li>
  <li>The <strong>mesoderm</strong>, lying in between, generates connective tissues, muscles, and bones, and plays a central role in organ formation.</li>
  <li>The <strong>endoderm</strong> is the innermost layer, forming structures such as the gut lining.</li>
</ul>

<p>The mesoderm can exist in two main cellular states: a migratory <strong>mesenchymal</strong> state and a more collective, epithelial-like state. Importantly, epithelial cells can transition into mesenchymal cells through EMT (epithelial–mesenchymal transition). This is the process that the authors of the paper focus on. Mesenchymal cells are crucial because, unlike epithelial cells, they are not tightly bound together. This allows them to migrate across the embryo, covering the endoderm and contributing to the formation of organs, bones, and other internal structures.</p>

<p>In this review, the authors discuss the main components of cells that drive different types of cell–cell interactions. They break down cellular behaviors into smaller parts, identify possible dynamics, and use these to explain how mesenchymal-type cells contribute to processes such as stripe formation in zebrafish and frogs. They also highlight how mesenchymal activity sculpts organ development.</p>

<p>In short, this review encourages readers to broaden their view of modeling biological systems. It shows examples of how mesenchymal biology is studied across contexts and demonstrates that models can address big questions—producing remarkable insights into development.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Until now, I was mainly focused on migratory cells of the immune/defense system. This paper opened my perspective to the broader phenomenon of migratory <strong>mesenchymal cells</strong> and their crucial role in morphogenesis and organ sculpting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the <strong>mesoderm</strong> and <strong>mesenchymal cells</strong> related to <strong>MSCs (mesenchymal stem/stromal cells)</strong>? In a way, yes. MSCs arise from the lineage of mesenchymal cells formed during the mesodermal stage, but they are not identical. MSCs are a specialized subset with stem-like properties, while embryonic mesenchymal cells are more general contributors to tissue and organ development.</p>
