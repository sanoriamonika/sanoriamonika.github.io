<p>Cancer, the abnormal growth and functioning of cells, has captured our attention for more than a century. Why does it occur? Why does it spread to different parts of the body (a process called metastasis)? Why are some types of cancer easier to cure if the cancerous tissue is removed, while in other cases the disease reappears? It has been observed that circulating tumor cell clusters (CTCs) have a much higher potential for metastasis than their single-cell counterparts. So how does the process progress from the epithelial layer to the stage of CTCs?</p>

<p>Epithelial cells undergo <strong>epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)</strong>, in which non-motile epithelial cells transition into motile mesenchymal cells. This is one of the central questions the authors aim to understand more deeply. They argue that the <strong>alignment strength</strong> of the cells plays an important role, in addition to adhesion and self-polarity. They suggest that while self-alignment and alignment with neighbors influence the direction of migration, these mechanisms can also lead to different collective behaviors. To explore this, they used <strong>Cellular Potts Model (CPM)</strong> simulations.</p>

<p>The Cellular Potts Model is a grid-based model in which a cell can occupy multiple lattice points, making it well-suited for capturing cell shape dynamics. Using a Monte Carlo method, the system evolves randomly, while energy minimization determines the evolution of cell boundaries. A constraint on cell volume or area is also imposed. In their simulations of motile and non-motile cells, the authors found that in the presence of non-motile cells, motile cells form smaller clusters and break apart more frequently. They compared this to simulations without non-motile cells, which highlighted that the <strong>environment strongly shapes the collective behavior of clusters</strong>.</p>
