  <li>what is work?</li>
  <li>why do we need to do it?</li>
  <li>where does this idea came from?</li>
  <li>how does idea of money changed the defination of work?</li>
  <li>why does pride and self respect and dignity is associte with work?</li>
  <li>what need does work fullfill that we inherintly wants to do work?</li>
  <li>why we started work and where have we reached now?</li>
  <li>what is the influance of work on the qaulity of life?</li>
  <li>how should we think about life and redefine work?</li>
</ul>

<p>Why do we want to work? 
What can work gives me that is not there in the life that I’m dying to work. I just want to do it. 
There’s no doubt that work gave me a lot of things.  Somehow it is a necessity. Necessity of the codependent society that I live in and the society to progress as a human being as efficiently as possible. We divided work among other human beings so that not a single human being has to do everything. Could not do the things that he or she likes to do. Sharing of work gave us at least the idea of it gave us. How do we want to spend it? What do we want to create? What is something within us that manifest itself to the fullest when we have full autonomy to do it? We are not crushed by the work of necessity of fulfilling my basic needs.</p>

<p>So in other words, because work was a beautiful concept originated by human beings to have a better quality of life. A smart idea through which we were able to fulfill our basic needs, but also are able to create something on the top of that.</p>

<p>When I think of that, it’s a beautiful idea. A genius idea I should say. A simple idea which made humans work together and slowly start segregating us from the other animals. Because I don’t think any other species is able to do cohesively work as we human can. Every day we are thriving for more efficiency. What more we are able to do with that time? What more we are able to create, how more we are able to enjoy?</p>

<p>And I have a doubt on the last point how more we are able to enjoy. I don’t know how much we are able to enjoy actually because given that these definitions of work and shared labor and the way we judge it in our society and the judging currency is sort of money. 
and which is added on the society through someone cunning playing with the idea of money.</p>
