        <p>What I will enjoy to work on? Why it is important? Who will benefit from it?
Active matter is domain that explain the non equilibrium processes of life. The central idea is that life has energy and it move. In other words it is study of tiny machines. Understanding the collective behavior of these tiny machine is like understanding the behavior of big machine given that it is of tiny machines, unlike real life machine which are made up parts which do not have life. 
Being a theorist my main interest is in understanding the basic laws that leads to these critical phenomena in these systems. Their motion, their structure formation, their survival and their death. A very simple set of laws that explains the behavior of these systems are ABPs which shows phase separation even in the presence of the any alignment or attractive interactions. The fact that they have energy (that they are machines) and they have volume. These two are sufficient enough to show clear phase separation and complex network formation. 
What I have done using these models have looked at the how does softness element of the entities can effect their behavior. Why it is important because all the cells and tissues are deformable they are not hard entities, so hard particle models for the non-equilibrium active particles are not right representation of these systems. To fill this gap in the modeling and biological systems we started working on these systems with our model we showed that softness is crucial parameter in the phase and structure formation. Softness delays the process of reaching the steady states, it decreases the order in the system leads towards the more disorder and that decay in the phase formation. This model shows that softness significantly effect the self organization and collective dynamical properties. In nature we always see these entities to be in the heterogeneous format. So we also looked at the soft and hard mixture of these two and those leads to a fascinating results of the complex network within the phase-separation. Which gives us information about that these simple active brownian particles are not as simple as we use to think about they have more complex and interesting physics hidden within them to be explored.
Eventually it leads me to explore the other such biological systems in my postdoc where we tried to understand a very specific problem of lymphocytes cancer cell migrations. Using agent based simulation techniques trues to find out the minimal rules that were necessary for these collective dynamics and that shed some light in their mechanism. In this one we could figure out the role of the cells internal dynamics and its relation with the outer collective dynamics of the cells. These cancer cells were moving under the external chemical gradient. This case was interesting to study because within out body this phenomena is happening continuously. Our cells responds to the chemical signal continuously and it is very important for overall functioning of the human being. When a bound is healed cells moved there too heal it under the guidance of signals when there are too many cells then they start moving away from that location. All these process are very effectively sensed and navigated by the cells, eg immune cells, nervous cells etc. 
Possible questions that can be explored with these models. I am interested to understand the effect of chemoattraction and chemorepulsion in these huge Systems. General effect on all the soft cell like particles. Also I in cancer studies we have seen that in most of cancer the cancer cells have high stiffness that the normal cells being it breast cancer or the lung cancer or also in the leukemia. With the help of my model I want to explore all these phenomena and study the underline reason and possible outcome of their effects and possibly how can one control them. 
My model can also be used to cell migration and the large scale migratory flocks too. Fish, and other. There is continuous information exchange between them and I am planning to extend my work in the</p>

<p>“Every book needs a structure, but that structure is going to be very different depending on whether you’re talking about fiction or nonfiction. Also, depending on which genre of fiction you’re talking about,” said author and publisher Noah Lukeman. “Romance might have its own demands versus mystery versus thriller versus science fiction.”
