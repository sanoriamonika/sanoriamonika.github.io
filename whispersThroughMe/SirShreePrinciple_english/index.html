        <p><strong>Focus on the Essence</strong></p>

<p>The essence is to surrender your inner self so that it can guide you toward building what you desire in life. Clearly signal your intentions because you have understood the essence. Let this understanding form principles for your life, and let your behavior align with those principles.</p>

<p>No matter how many difficulties surround you, whether they are internal or external, continue to act in alignment with what needs to be done. When one resolves to do this, even the biggest obstacles—mountainous challenges—move out of the way.</p>

<p>Some people achieve this in life, inspiring others to believe they too can do it. A ray of hope emerges for humanity, often stuck in life’s maze, wondering if escape is possible. In this maze, additional sufferings arise, leaving no room for flexibility—sufferings born of the mind, from others’ taunts. At times, a person loses hope.</p>

<p><strong>Then comes the realization:</strong></p>

<p><em>What is this game of life? How do I utilize the time? in a way that to applaud myself, feel pride, and experience the grace that has allowed me to enjoy life’s beauty</em></p>

<p>This realization comes because:</p>

<p>• Knowledge was heard and understood.</p>

<p>• The essence was grasped.</p>

<p>• Decisions were made accordingly—not in sorrow, anger, or even in the excitement of joy.</p>

<p>Thus, one is saved from making promises in haste, which could otherwise lead to high stakes and costly decisions. People often make promises in excitement and live enslaved by them, risking their true purpose for fleeting emotions.</p>

<p><strong>Awareness is Key</strong></p>

<p>One must stay alert during excitement and anger. In anger, avoid responding as it only invites more trouble. Life is already short; why add unnecessary complications?</p>

<p>Often, humans create problems not given to them. If life itself complicates 10%, humans add 90% of their own, then blame the world. But what is the essence of this world? If misunderstood, the world deceives, leading to frustration, sorrow, and complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding the Essence</strong></p>

<p>Reflect on the essence of your actions:</p>

<p>• <em>What am I doing? What is the essence behind it?</em></p>

<p>• <em>What is the essence of the life I’ve lived so far? What should be the essence of the remaining life?</em></p>

<p>Let your principles derive from this essence, guiding behaviors in various situations:</p>

<p>1. When you are happy.</p>

<p>2. When you are sad.</p>

<p>3. When you are alone.</p>

<p>4. When among people.</p>

<p>5. When caring for your body.</p>

<p>6. When working on livelihood.</p>

<p>7. When pursuing your art.</p>

<p>8. When innovating and creating new ideas.</p>

<p>Satisfaction arises when the essence is correct. Once this is achieved, everything else naturally aligns.</p>

<p><strong>The Disruption Happens When the Essence is Forgotten</strong></p>

<p>When people forget the essence, they question the purpose of all their efforts. But it is possible to stabilize oneself. Reflect: <em>What is the essence? What am I doing, and for what purpose? Can this journey be joyous?</em></p>

<p>If no clear path is visible, take time to reflect. Sit with yourself. Suddenly, clarity appears, clouds disperse, and the path ahead becomes visible.</p>

<p><strong>Small Steps Make Big Things Happen</strong></p>

<p>Every significant creation starts with small steps. Look at any great achievement—companies, tourist destinations, or institutions—they all began with an idea and a small action. The first step was taken without waiting for complete clarity.</p>

<p><strong>Start Acting</strong></p>

<p>People often make the mistake of waiting for clarity before beginning. But the truth is, actions connect naturally. One step leads to another. The work done with insight surpasses the limits of logic and reasoning because it stems from within—from “inside out,” not “outside in.”</p>

<p>The external world can be overwhelming, filled with distractions. However, when the journey starts internally, unimaginable outcomes unfold. Some stumble upon the right path unknowingly, while others pray for guidance. Taking even uncertain steps toward what seems appropriate brings light for the next move.</p>

<p><strong>Nature Observes and Responds</strong></p>

<p>Nature observes those who take steps. The light of the next step shines for those who move forward. Pray, act on the signals you receive, and the path will illuminate itself.</p>
