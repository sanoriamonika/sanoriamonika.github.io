<p>I came out to leave for home from my office. I looked at some people and then suddenly a thought came to my mind. The people the guy actually home I was looking at was little overweight.<br />
<br />
Next thing that crossed my mind that this is done by some other human beings. Then another thought comes my mind. We emphasize in spirituality as well as in material world to focus on oneself focus on one’s growth and that messes somehow make us to shut down, shut down towards the needs and well-being of the others. Then the world is divided into I and others.<br />
<br />
Because the bad way of eating is not something that has originated through the nature. We have figured out these are the weaknesses of humans and we use them the big companies for their benefit with the sacrificing the health of the others. Because when you’re looking at the world from the other’s perspective, it’s you the one who should have everything that you desire that you want from the others on a one minute manipulating way by manipulating their weaknesses by exploiting their weaknesses, etc.<br />
<br />
It made me take. Actually not think I’ll say that this was another thought that crossed my mind at the same time. That isn’t it the same thing that we did with the him with the animals? We we first learn how to control them and then we use them for our beneficial benefit. The one who could control them.<br />
<br />
Where are we heading with all these things? We humans cannot come to a simple fact that food is something that is the need of the body. We have made it to to exploit to get things out of other reuse desires of humans to make them a slave of ourselves. We think we are intelligent creature, but we are unable to reach to a common common idea of prosperas health and living.<br />
<br />
That look like human cuz I’m a dudes in the picture. We have not learned how to live together for the well-being and of each other for a joy.</p>
