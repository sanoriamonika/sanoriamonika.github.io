        <p>Some topics that fascinate us include artificial intelligence, life on other planets, life on Mars, aliens, or what we can broadly call extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence is here, and many monotonous technical tasks are now being replaced by it. It is capable of logical thinking to some extent as well. We are in a transition period: AI is helping us complete our tasks quickly, but because it has only recently entered our lives, we still do not fully understand its potential. Over time, we will become accustomed to it, and the nature of jobs, research, and many of the tasks around us will reach a steady state again, influenced by its presence. One thing is certain: AI is here, and it is changing humanity and the way we function.</p>

<p>Human beings have always been curious about the sky. I think the sky was one of the earliest reasons we began to reason, question, and dream beyond ourselves. Wherever we look in human history, astronomy—or some form of observing the sky—was often the starting point of scientific thought. From asking what lies at the center of the universe to mapping star systems, we created stories and theories. The desire to understand the sky led to the development of many branches of mathematics as well. The question of “what is on the other side” has been with humanity from the moment we began thinking scientifically or identifying ourselves as modern humans.</p>

<p>Are we alone? Is there anyone else out there? What exists beyond what we can see? For centuries, we have been trying to answer these questions. As we developed tools, art, and technology, the way we approached these questions changed. Each generation has been more curious than the previous one, building on the questions left behind. We ask whether there is biological life on other planets and, if so, what form it might take. Would such life be built from the same elements—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen—in similar proportions? What would happen if we encountered them? Could it lead to contamination or the disappearance of one or the other?</p>

<p>We also wonder: Is there artificial life? If so, how do we contact it? If we do make contact, how do we interact safely? What precautions are needed? Who represents humanity? These unknowns make us anxious, curious, and excited all at the same time.</p>

<p>Humans are capable of going beyond ourselves through the tools we have created—mathematics, science, computers, artificial intelligence. We continually push our boundaries, though we may not know why. It simply seems to be the only way we know how to live. When every human is capable of asking different questions, forming hypotheses, and exploring answers, how do we decide what to believe or where to begin? How do we distinguish imagination from reality? This is why scientific approaches exist: systematic methods that allow us to test our assumptions, move forward, verify, correct, and repeat. This process ensures we stay anchored to reality, because otherwise anyone could claim anything, and we would be standing on shaky ground.</p>

<p>In addition to these tools, human creativity plays an important role. Over time, as certain ideas repeatedly proved themselves through validation and testing, we developed an intuition to trust these methods. Testing hypotheses helps us see whether to continue with an idea or abandon it. And if something remains uncertain, we keep exploring new ways to verify it—using new tools and remaining open to new possibilities. It helps to take everything with a grain of salt unless it has been rigorously proven.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is comforting to realize that no one knows everything. Each of us holds only a part of the puzzle. Scientists try to make each piece as clear as possible so that together, we get a glimpse of the bigger picture.</p>

<p>I’m curious to see how AI will help us—or speed up—our search for answers to these long-standing unknown questions. Like any tool we have developed, AI can become either a friend or a fool. Its value will depend on how we choose to use it.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that scientists are asking hundreds of questions at any moment. Some become popular because they turn out to be correct; others disappear with time. Humanity eventually absorbs the ones that stand the test of evidence, and they permanently shift our understanding of the future. For example, the simple yet profound idea that we are not at the center of the universe took centuries for even brilliant minds to accept. But today, most people have no difficulty with it, although exceptions always exist.</p>
