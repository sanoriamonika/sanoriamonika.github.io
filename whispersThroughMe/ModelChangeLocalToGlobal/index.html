        <h2 id="change-in-model-from-local-to-global">Change in model from Local to global</h2>
<p>A thought came that because of this globalization of the digitalization now we human who were always trying to be better than surrounding. That’s what we asked everyone to become to every student to be the best to come first in the class right to beat the other classmates we work continuously. We were teaching these things to our children to be the best to be the best to to be the best while earning the money to be the best in some skill before the internet we were not aware of someone very big depending upon what. What were the source of sharing information? You had somebody in local area with whom you were competing + depending upon this resources available there you could. There were the possibility that you could become better from that person or you find some other ways to find that that is not the way you wanted to do records that sorts off achievement comes with some sort of disadvantages that you are not interested. But what happened with the globalization because of her training to become the best we are. We have become the slave of our training because what has happened? Is it because of the globalization now are idle and has become a global thing? There is this one person which is the best in their field and because everything is connected to everything, approximately there will be one at the top. There could be many reasons why that person is the best. Maybe it was trained that way. Maybe that was natural. Maybe their surrounding the the availability to that person was so like the resources were so good available to that person or maybe there are some sorts of biasing going on. Maybe that person is at the right time at right right position at right time, right? With all the resources. We don’t know anything about that. We don’t know what are the reason but only thing we know is that person is the best. So we only left in the situation of comparing that person comparing ourselves with that person with somebody who is the big thing and that the big thing is sometimes so big in that particular idea that it’s just not possible to beat that person because earlier as it was local in a sense you had the sense of. If this you are going to get this thing then you have to practice in a certain way. They’ll come with some disadvantages. But now because this idol is so far away we don’t know nothing about it and we end up just comparing ourselves with them.. and this thing. So this comparison is not going to take us any year and I can see the entire world is rushing through that problem. And I can see why the mental health problem are increasing in the world because of our tune out because we were trained to become the best earlier that best was local which was achievable. So there were a lot of people who were happy. This competition is with one global and it’s not possible to achieve just crazy. From whom you want to be met her who’s your comparison but but do you want to it to when up to when when you’re going to stop? You know how it looks to me now if I try to visualize earlier picture and now’s picture. So imagine earlier picture was a big square sheet and there were different dots at the point with the multiple intensity with the different intensities and intensity of the color shows. What was the caliber in that person right, right? So how this competition model look like that everyone was running toward their local that dot. But now with the globalization the model has changed now. Imagine the square paper and there is one highly intense. In the beginning, sorry at the center and everyone is running toward it. Everyone and. And in the process a lot of people are being killed and it’s just impossible to reach that. One point will be all are trying to reach and we see a lot of mental health patients because we have stop appreciating what we had. I was happy when I was at a small village. Because I was the smartest children in that area, my family carry that pride with them. But as I moved to different cities as I moved letter by letter, I have realized most are smart people than me. And I in the process. I got a time to it just according to the next ladder. But I feel that with the globalization you don’t have the time. You have been provided with certain type of skill set which can take you at certain positions and you can have things for yourself which could be good or bad or anyway likes. But you have some some Target which is so far away which is so far away. That is impossible to achieve it and hence the suffering and hence the mental health cases and hence the suicidal cases and hence the problems.</p>
