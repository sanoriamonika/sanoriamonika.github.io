<h1>Research</h1>

<p>My research explores how self-propelled particles and cells organize, deform, and move collectively in complex environments. I combine computational modeling with theoretical analysis to uncover the physical principles governing active matter systems, from synthetic colloidal particles to living cells. My work bridges physics and biology, revealing how simple interaction rules and feedback mechanisms give rise to emergent collective behaviors with implications for understanding biological processes and designing novel materials.</p>

<h2>Softness-Dependent Phase Separation in Active Brownian Particles</h2>

<p>During my PhD, I investigated how particle softness fundamentally alters motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in active Brownian particles. While hard active particles form dense, compact clusters, I discovered that soft particles create porous, interconnected networks that continuously reorganize. My work revealed that the interplay between elasticity and self-propulsion controls transitions between compact, fluid-like, and percolating states. Using Brownian dynamics simulations and statistical analysis, I identified a novel percolation transition in these systems and characterized it by comparing critical exponents with literature values, confirming its distinct universality class.</p>

<h2>Chemotactic Migration and Instabilities in Cell Clusters</h2>

<p>My current postdoctoral research focuses on understanding how multicellular clusters migrate in response to chemical gradients. Using particle-based computational models informed by experimental observations of malignant lymphocyte clusters, I study chemotactic instabilities where clusters exhibit shape deformations, rotation, and fragmentation depending on gradient strength and cluster size. A particularly striking aspect of my current work is the counterintuitive behavior observed at high gradient strengths: while single cells exhibit chemorepulsion and move away from the gradient source, larger clusters display chemoattraction and migrate up the gradient. I am investigating the physical mechanisms underlying this size-dependent reversal, revealing how collective effects and inter-cellular interactions enable clusters to maintain forward migration even under conditions that repel individual cells - behavior with critical implications for understanding cancer metastasis and immune cell trafficking.</p>

<h2>Active Polymers and Coordinated Motion</h2>

<p>In parallel, I develop active polymer and follower-chain models to understand how coordinated locomotion emerges in elongated active systems, with applications to biological filaments like microtubules and robotic systems. These minimal models incorporate the effects of chirality on active motion and explore escape time dynamics of flexible active swimmers. By studying how local interactions and geometric constraints shape collective behavior along the chain, this work aims to uncover fundamental principles governing living and synthetic active systems.</p>
